\section{INTRODUCTION}
 \subsection{Revision History}
 At this moment, this is the first version of the document.
 \subsection{Purpose and Scope}
 This document describes how the integration should proceed. Integration testing means that we need to verify all the components needed for the overall system should work correctly not only individually but also in combination. In this document, we provide the steps needed to follow in order to get a fully functional system. More specifically, the elements need to be tested, the testing strategy, sequence of integration, test description, tools and stubs will be presented in the following parts. 
 \subsection{List of Definitions and Abbreviations}
	 \begin{itemize}
	 	\item RASD : Requirement Analysis and Specification Document
	 	\item DD : Design Document
	 	\item Guest : All the users of the system who have not performed a Log in operation yet
	 	\item User : After a Guest logs in, he/she becomes a User
	 	\item Subcomponent : each of the low level component realizing specific functionalities of the subsystem
	 	\item subsystem : a functional unit of the system
 	 \end{itemize}
 \subsection{List of Reference Documents}

\section{INTEGRATION STRATEGY}
 \subsection{Entry Criteria}
 There are several entry criteria to be completed before the integration testing phase can begin. 
 \begin{itemize}
	 \item RASD and DD documents are completed
	 \item Components have to be unit tested before the integration testing
	 \item The required driver and stub have already been developed
	 \item database is fully functioned
\end{itemize}
The application subsystem may not be fully developed at this moment, however the interface between Application tier and Server tier is a must for testing to proceed.
 \subsection{Elements to be Integrated}
 The system is divided into 3 subsystems  according to the 3 tier architecture we chose in the DD : Application, Server, Database.
 This document mainly focuses on the integration testing for the Server side.
 The following components needed to be integrated:
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item Guest Application Manager
 	\item User Application Manager
 	\item Car Application Manager
 	\item Database Manager
 \end{itemize}
The above components are the basic low-level components required for higher level functionalities of the system. Besides the components we need to develop by ourselves, some external systems and API are used:
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item Google Map API
 	\item Bank Service system
 \end{itemize}
 \subsection{Integration Testing Strategy}
 For testing the integration of components, we choose the bottom-up approach. By bottom-up approach, we start by the components which have no dependency of other components and the very fundamental components providing services to all others. In our system, we start from the Database Manager component. The reason behind it is that basically all of our functions need Database Manager. Thus it is natural and easy to begin with it (the bottom level) and add other components step by step. 
 \subsection{Sequence of Component/Function Integration}
 Basically we have three subsystems in our system : Application side, Server side and Database side. We will focus on the first two subsystem and neglect the last one because we'll use a DBMS from outside.
  \subsubsection{Software Integration Sequence}
  (1) Application side
  The application subsystem is composed of two components : User application and Car application. These two components are parallel and do not have any dependency on each other. The dependency of these two components lie on the Server side. Thus, these two components can be developed separately but can only be tested after the Server side is functional.

 (2) Server side
 The Server has four components : Database Manager, Guest Application Manager, User Application Manager and Car Application Manager. We'll start from Database Manager and add other components step by step. 
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item 1 Database Manager
 \end{itemize}
Database Manager is the most basic and fundamental component in our system, thus it will be tested firstly.

 	\caption{Database Manager}
 \end{figure}

 \begin{itemize}
 	\item 2.1 Gust Application Manager
 \end{itemize}
After testing the Database Manager, we'll proceed with our testing procedure with Guest Application Manager which is responsible for user registration and log in.
Note the this testing can be proceeded in parallel with the Car Application Manager.

\end{figure}
 
  \begin{itemize}
 	\item 2.2 Car Application Manager
 \end{itemize}
Car Application Manager is responsible for managing the car information with database.

	\caption{Car Application Manager}
\end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
	\item 3 User Application Manager
\end{itemize}
All the services for the users can only be accessed after performing the log in operation. However User Application Manager and Guest Application Manager do not have dependency on each other. User Application Manager is responsible for rental services. More preciously, getting available cars, making reservations and unlocking the door.

\newpage
  \subsubsection{Subsystem Integration Sequence}
  After testing the components in the Server and Application sides, we can begin to test the integration of subsystems. Since a full functional requirement needs to operate on all the three subsystems, we integrate them all together.
