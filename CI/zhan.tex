\section{ProductionRun.java}

\subsection{Initialization and Declaration}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
All variable and class member are declared with correct type and the right visibility.
\item
All variable is being used only into the scope where they are declared.
\item
We have not a constructor with empty parameter, so when declared there are not a default constructor is called. But when the class ProductionRun is initialized, there is a constructor that can be called.
\item
All object references are initialized before use.
\item
Several attributes variable have not been initialized explicitly. They may assume a standard value in phase of computation. 
\item
Almost declaration appear at the beginning of block, except few of them are declared after some instructions.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Method Calls}
All parameters are presented in the correct order.\\
We have found two pair of method that have same name: getEstimatedTaskTime and recalculateEstimatedCompletionDate, but each of them is refer to the same functionality.\\
All method return correct type of value.
\subsection{Array}
There are no problem with off-by-one error or out-of-bounds, we manager the array using iterator instead of index.
\subsection{Object Comparison}
In class is always used == to compare a object with NULL, and just one use equals (line 85).
\subsection{Output Format}
The class return always the output desired.\\
The error message is manager in the classes of exception, so from this class we can not ague on the comprehensiveness.
\subsection{Computation, Comparisons and Assignments}
In this java class we have not long and complex arithmetic expression or some to be take with particular attention, like division, therefore, there are not operator precedence problems.\\
Other operators are also into correct form.\\
The code is has no contain any explicit and implicit type conversions.
\subsection{Exceptions}
For every try statement there are at least one catch statement that take over exceptions.
\subsection{Flow of Control}
In the class there are not any switch statement, and for other loop they are correct instructions to form them. 
\subsection{Files}
This class does not manage the files.

\section{ViewerServletRequest.java}

\subsection{Naming Conventions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
The name for class ViewerServletRequest.java, and all name of its attributes, method and constant are meaningful.
\item
There is only one one-character variable, and it is used as parameter of catch statement, therefore it is "throwaway" variable.
\item
The class name is composed with three nouns, initial letter of each word is capitalized.
\item
We have not define any interface within the class.
\item 
There is only method in class: getParameter(), it contains a verb, also, every addition word begin with capitalized letter.
\item
We have not attributes begin with an underscore, whatever, the initial word is lowercase, and first letter of each others is capitalized.
\item
In class has a constant is written in lowercase:
\begin{table}[hpb]
\label{my-label}
\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline
public final static String module = ViewerServletRequest.class.getName();\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table} 
\\Where 'module' should be written using all uppercase.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Indention}
For all indentation, we adopt the convention of four space. There are not tab used to indent. 
\subsection{Braces}
Bracing style adopted for entire class is "Kernighan and Ritchie" style. For all body of all if-else,while,do-while,try-catch and for, the curly braces are used also for only one statement.
\subsection{File Organization}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
For each section there is a blank line to separate from others.
\item
There only few line exceed 80 character (38,48,54 and 59). Neither of them exceed 120 characters.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Wrapping Lines}
Every expression in the class fit on a single line, so the convention is valid.
\subsection{Comments}
The class is completely lack of comment.
